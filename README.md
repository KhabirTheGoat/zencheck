# Zen Check

Zen Check is a lightweight web-based checklist tool designed to help you get tasks done and move on with your day.  No clutter, no friction, no productivity theater.

Create a checklist, tick things off, and bounce.
If you want persistence, you can import and export your data across sessions.
If you don’t, use it and forget it. That’s the point.
